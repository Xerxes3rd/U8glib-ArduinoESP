# U8glib-ArduinoESP
Modifications of the U8glib library for Arduino on the ESP8266.

Currently using source from: https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib

To use this, replace platform.txt in C:\Users\(YOUR_USERNAME)\AppData\Roaming\Arduino15\packages\esp8266\hardware\esp8266\1.6.5-947-g39819f0 with the one included.  This will allow the library to build, but it still may not run properly.
